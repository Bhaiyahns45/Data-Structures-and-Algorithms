Hash Table:

Hash table using linked list.

To handle collision seperate chaining is used.

Hash function:

key- as string

Hash value calculation:

	hash_value = (sum of ASCII value of all char of key) % (size of hash table)

	ex- key = "10", hash size =10

   	sum of ascii value of "1" and "0" is 49+48 = 97
    	hash_value = 97 % 10 = 7

	therefore this key store at index [7] in hash table


Separate Chaining: 
	The idea is to make each cell of hash table point to a linked list of records that have same hash function value.


• Insert
	- to insert the element in hash table with its key and value

• Delete
	- to delete the element from the hash table using key

• Contains
	- to check whether a particular element is present in hash table or not by its key

• Get Value by key
	- to get the value of element by its key

• Size
	- to get the size of hash table

• Iterator
	- to print the hash table using iterator

• Traverse/Print
	- to traverse/print the hash table
